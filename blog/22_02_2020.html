                <p>Looking back at this time with my buddy Sandro, it feels like it was so long ago!  I think this was in October of 2017(I think).  Anyways, he has grown so much since then (his english skills as well as <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="maturity level" data-meaning="(noun) -emotional/mental evolution of a child">maturity level</span>, physically).  I started working with him when he was four years old if I remember correctly.  It was a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="maturity level" data-meaning="(verb) -to intimidate or discourage">daunting</span> task at first.  He knew absolutely no English and my <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="track record" data-meaning="(noun) -statistical history">track record</span> with kids wasn't the best at that time.</p>

                <p>Our first months were quite <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="monotonous" data-meaning="(adjective) -tediously repetitive">monotonous</span> for me.  ABC's, memory games, flashcards (the same ones again and again and again).  Him being so young, to keep his attention was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="excruciating" data-meaning="(verb) -to inflict extreme pain/torture">excruciating</span>at times.  After studying for six months, he <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="memorize" data-meaning="(verb) - to learn by heart">memorized</span> the alphabet, his vocabulary began to develop, and his comfort level with me went to another level.  Sometimes though, our meetings were a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="grind" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a laborious, challenging process/task">grind</span>!</p>

                <p>Sandro and I developed an unbreakable <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="bond" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to form a close personal relationship">bond</span> at a young age.  Much of it having to do with the parallels in our childhoods.  I grew up in a divorced family and so does he.  I am able to relate to his moods, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="confusion" data-meaning="(noun) -lack of clarity">confusion</span>, and questions without <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="legitimate" data-meaning="(adjective) - based on logical reasoning">"legitimate"</span> answers.  The results of that connection between us has made our english lessons more effective,  a sense of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="camaraderie" data-meaning="(noun) - spirit of trust and familiarity between friends">camaraderie</span>, as well as <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="genuine" data-meaning="(adjective) - authentic, real">genuine</span> friendships between his family and I.  </p>

                <p>I miss our face-to-face meetings, homemade syrniki-it's like a cutlet made from cottage cheese, milk and so on... delicious desserts from his grandma,  chatting with Mama Tanya, and more.  I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="appreciate" data-meaning="(verb) - to be thankful for, to value, recognize the significance of something">appreciate</span> the fact that we are able to continue his progress and development through video sessions twice a week. I am looking forward to visiting Russia in June and spending time with him and his family at their summer home!</p>

                <p>Sandro today and Sandro four years ago are two different people. His English has skyrocketed in the past two years.  We speak in English most of the time.  I'm quite surprised that he is so <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="engage" data-meaning="(verb) - to involve, participate">engaged</span> in our video sessions.  I was a bit skeptical of the idea at first due to his age.  He has <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="prove" data-meaning="(verb) - to verify, establish truth or validity">proven</span> me wrong!  I'm so <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="proud" data-meaning="(adjective) - feeling satisfaction, honor, dignity">proud</span>of how far he has come and to see the work that I have <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="put into" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) -to invest">put into</span> him, the results speak for themselves!  Love my extended family!</p>

                <p>Take a look at this video of him and I discussing fears and girls. Our topic was about Halloween, what is scary, what are you afraid of.  He connects fears to girls at his age.  It always gives me a good <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="chuckle" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to laugh">chuckle</span>!</p>
