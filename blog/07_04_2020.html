        <i>(Hint: click the word to see the translation)</i>

        <p>I have been seeing a lot of complaints on social media recently.     People have been <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Object" data-meaning="(verb) - to disagree, refuse, deny">objecting</span> to the "stay home" orders <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Initiate" data-meaning="(verb) - to begin, to get going">initiated</span> by their governments and decide that they know what is best.  The <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Evidence" data-meaning="(noun) - something which makes clear">evidence</span>  is telling.  Videos and photos of hundreds of people laying on beaches, spending time in public places, parents allowing their kids to mingle with others on the playground, etc.   A lack of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Accountability" data-meaning="(noun) - to be liable, responsible for something">accountability</span>, selfishness, and carelessness are some reasons that this virus is going to be <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Dragged out" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - extended">dragged out</span>. Many more people are going to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Suffer" data-meaning="(verb) - to go through pain, penalty, punishment">suffer</span> due to others ignorance and self-centeredness.  It's a pity. </p>

        <p>I believe that a great deal of people are <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Live in denial" data-meaning="(phrase) - to refuse to accept the truth">living in denial</span> about the changes we are going through, the adaptations which we need to make in order to survive this period.  Why are people refusing to accept the reality?  A few reasons</p>

        <p><strong>Fear</strong></p>

        <p><span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Inherently" data-meaning="(adverb) - to exist in someone permanently and inseparable">Inherently</span>, humans fear what they can't relate to, don't understand, and don't have the answers to. We don't like the unknown, we prefer to live in our  safe, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Sheltered" data-meaning="(adjective) - protected, defended">sheltered</span> version of reality rather than accept the truth.  We can't see what the future holds,we want to know what tomorrow brings.  We   <strong><u>haven't found</u></strong> a light at the end of the tunnel yet.  We have a million questions, but  few answers.  A <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Lack of" data-meaning="(collocation) - to be without, deficient of">lack of</span> clarity.    Governments tell us something one day, the next they <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Backtrack" data-meaning="(verb) - to withdraw from an opinion or statement">backtrack</span> on what they have said and say the opposite.  Confusion............stress........</p>

        <p><strong>Resistance to adaptation and evolution</strong></p>

        <p>We are being forced to be like water, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Adjust" data-meaning="(verb) - to modify so that it fits, corresponds, accommodates">adjusting</span> to the situation daily.  Some people are absolutely <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Uncompromising" data-meaning="(adjective) - rigid, inflexible,adhere to a single position or principle">uncompromising</span> in their views and ideas and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Unwilling" data-meaning="(adjective) - opposed to, resistant">unwilling</span> to be flexible.  Many people  <strong><u>have lost</u></strong> their jobs or  <strong><u>have been placed</u></strong> on "forced vacation" lately.  Yes, it is an uncomfortable situation.  It isn't unique to just you or I.  Instead of panicking and thinking about the fact that you don't have a job, look at the bigger picture.  Millions of people just like you and I are going through the same thing right now.  Perspective is key.  Adapt and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Overcome" data-meaning="(verb) - to win, to prevail">overcome</span>.

        <p><strong>The <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Herd" data-meaning="(noun) - a group of similar organisms, usually animals">herd</span> mentality</strong></p>

        <p>Media, social media, talking heads, celebrities.  There is so much garbage spreading around.  One person hears something which is a convenient point of view and they jump on that ship without checking the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Hull" data-meaning="(noun) - the shell of a ship">hull</span> for a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Gaping" data-meaning="(adjective) - wide open">gaping</span> <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Breach" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a hole, forced entry">breach</span> or a qualified captain.  This information gets <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Pass around" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to distribute">passed around</span>, more sailors are recruited to man the ship. Result-the herd aggressively <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Validates" data-meaning="(verb) - confirm, legalize">validates</span> this idea, conspiracy theory, point of view and goes on a campaign, promoting it to the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Masses" data-meaning=" - a large group of people">masses</span>.</p>

        <p>What can we do to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Alleviate" data-meaning="(verb) - to reduce, decrease, soften">alleviate</span> our stresses, reduce our fears, and transform these negatives into positives?  Most of us  <strong><u>have been afforded</u></strong> much more free time recently.  Instead of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Sulk" data-meaning="(verb) - a negative, pouty mood">sulking</span> in our homes, stressing about the fact that we have to stay home, and allowing negativity to bring us down, we can all do things to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Distract" data-meaning="(verb) - to take the attention from something">distract</span> us from the current situation. </p>

        <p>We all have more time to spend with our family and loved ones(assuming that you share the same house).  Full-time jobs and usual routines take us away from those most important to us.  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Embrace" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to receive willingly, eagerly, happily">Embrace</span> this time with them! </p>

        <p>The internet is the world's biggest database of information.  People always find excuses to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Put off" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to delay or postpone">put off</span> doing something.  </p>

        <p>"I want to go back to school, but I'm too busy with work".</p>

        <p>"I want to ______, but it doesn't fit my schedule". </p>

        <p>I'll bet you can't say that now.  Online education has been developing over the past decade and is seeing a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Surge" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a significant increase">surge</span> in <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Demand" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to ask for urgently">demand</span>  and popularity.  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Work on" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to spend time improving something, making progress towards something">Work on</span> that university degree, take a self-development course, study a foreign language(like English).  There are hundreds of options out there and some are even free of charge!  Contact me when you have questions about studying English by way of Zoom or Skype with me!</p>

        <p><span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Destress" data-meaning="(verb) - remove stress">Destress</span>! <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Unwind" data-meaning="(verb) - relax">Unwind</span>!  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Catch up on" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to get current with something">Catch up on</span> a TV series that <strong><u>has been</u></strong> on your "to do" list for awhile, watch some movies, read a book or two, experiment with new recipes in the kitchen.  Oh, and if you are a child at heart and enjoy playing video games, now is the time to get through one of those epics games such as The Witcher, Dragon Age, and the Final Fantasy 7 remake which releases in three days! Take advantage of this time to relax at home.  Once things go back to normal, people will eventually go back to complaining about not having enough time to relax.  Get it in now!</p>

        <p>"Get the best out of life, don't let life best you"</p>

        <p>What does my quote mean?</p>

        <p>-what is the meaning of my quote, the last words?</p>

        <p>It means to take advantage of life, take all of the positives you can from it.  Don't let life beat you up, bring you down</p>

        <p><strong>Pay attention to the highlighted constructions</strong></p>

        <p>have/has+3rd form</p>

        <p><strong>Present Perfect Simple</strong></p>

        <p>-it has many functions</p>

        <p>If you scroll up and take a look, you will see these constructions used with recently and lately a few times.  One function of present perfect is to say that something happened not long ago in the past.</p>

        <p><strong>Key indicators: recently, lately, just</strong></p>

        <p>-using the word "ago" does not fit with present perfect</p>

        <p>I ate lunch five minutes ago.</p>

        <p>I have just eaten lunch</p>

        <p>Both statements express the fact that the action happened not long ago, however "ago" is a reference of finished time and cannot be used with present perfect</p>

        <p>There are a few more functions of this tense.  For more information, get ahold of me and lets take some steps to improving your English skills!</p>
