        <p>Day 19- the number of days of my first <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Op" data-meaning="(noun) - short for operation">op</span>.  Also, the number of days I've been restricted to my flat, and roof, thank god!  I can't say the two situations are similar.  Here, I can still go downstairs to the market and buy food, alcohol, snacks, etc.  I can also go up to the roof and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Soak up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to absorb">soak up</span> some <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Ray" data-meaning="(noun) - a beam of light">rays</span>, do my workout, and take in the view at sunset.  Netflix, Youtube, etc(on a sub, we had very limited entertainment, internet was impossible).  Also, I'm "stuck" with my wife.  I feel like the luckiest person in the world to have the love of my life by side throughout this.  There is no one else I would want to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Go through" data-meaning="(collocation) - to pass, elapse) ">go through</span> this with! And last, but not least...I brought my PS4 with me from Russia.  It looks like a wise move at this point, a nice <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Getaway" data-meaning="(noun) - escape">getaway</span> from reality.

        <p>On a "boat", entertainment consisted of a small selection of films that we would watch in the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Galley" data-meaning="(noun) - navy word for cafeteria">galley</span> as a group unless you had your own laptop.  A library of books that were passed around amongst the crew(I think i read every Tom Clancy novel written up to 2005), or some downloaded games on a personal laptop(back when laptops were big, clunky, and a far comparison from what everyone uses today!)  Some boats also were able to fit in a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Treadmill" data-meaning="(noun) - an exercise machine to run on">treadmill</span>, an exercise bike, or some free weights.  Quite often near the reactor compartment or the smoking area.  Doubly beneficial, right?  Oh, and hot <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Racking" data-meaning="(noun) - shared bed)">racking</span>! That is something I don't miss.</p>

        <p>What is hot racking I'm sure you are asking yourself......</p>

        <p>Simply put, you share "your" rack(meaning bed) with one or two other guys on your team.  When I was working an eight-hour shift, my trainee was sleeping in "my" rack.  Then another trainee or operator would sleep in it for another eight hours, then back to me again.  Working 12s( a 12 hour shift or more) was much more preferable.  Then you would only have to share your bed with one other person.   The comforts of sub life! </p>

        </div>
        <p>Other <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Obvious" data-meaning="(adjective) - clear">obvious</span> things missing on a sub-a market, alcohol selection, a sunset, and fresh air.  The closest came to a sunset on a boat was staring at a black and white digital display of the view from the periscope.  Depressing.......</p>

        <p>My first trip on a sub went by quickly.  It was quite intense.  18 hour days of training and working.  Six hours of sleep or less I'd say.  My rack, all of the "riders"(guys temporarily assigned to a platform for specific missions) racks were usually in the torpedo room so sleep wasn't always peaceful.  Lights were on, people walking by your bed, torpedomen working, talking.  The one constant was the sound of the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Fuel" data-meaning="(noun) - gas, petrol">fuel</span> in the tomahawk missiles <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Swish" data-meaning="(verb) - to move with a sound, like waves washing on the shore">swishing</span> back and forth as the submarine <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Rock" data-meaning="(verb) - to sway, swing back and forth">rocked</span> gently back and forth below the surface of the water.  It should have been more alarming than anything I suppose.  After all, it was a gigantic rocket meant to rain down death and destruction upon the enemy.</p>

        <p>I made history on that trip, that I'll never forget.  At my own expense of course.  I can say that my supervisor <u><strong>hadn't been supervising</strong></u> so much up to this <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Monumental" data-meaning="(adjective) - historical, significant">monumental</span> moment.  I woke up from a deep <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Slumber" data-meaning="(noun) - deep sleep">slumber</span>, and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Stumble" data-meaning="(verb) - to walk unsteadily">stumbled</span> to the head(sailor word for bathroom).  There was some sign on the bathroom stall door which I didn't give much attention to.  I was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Groggy" data-meaning="(adjective) - dazed, weak">groggy</span>, my vision <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Hazy" data-meaning="(adjective) - unclear">hazy</span>,my <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Bladder" data-meaning="(noun) - a sack which holds liquid">bladder</span> about to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Burst" data-meaning="(noun) - explode">burst</span>.  I did my duties and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Zip up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to fasten">zipped up</span> my <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Overalls" data-meaning="(noun) - a one piece uniform)">overalls</span>.  I reached for the lever <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Coat" data-meaning="(verb) - layered, covered">coated</span> in red paint to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Flush" data-meaning="(verb) - a rush of flowing water">flush</span> the toilet and pulled it.  This strange noise <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Bellow out" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - a loud roar, sound">bellowed out</span> from the depths of the metallic beast as I opened "the hatch". It was like someone <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Gargle" data-meaning="(verb) - to wash or rinse the throat with water">gargling</span>, but mechanical, pressurized.  All of a sudden, liquid, organic waste, bodily fluid of every type <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Spew" data-meaning="(verb) - to discharge, eject strongly">spewed</span> out of this toilet and covered me completely.  I had no idea what had just happened!  Some guys ran in and asked me what I <u><strong>had done</strong></u>.  I was so confused.  I felt like I <u><strong>had just committed</strong></u> a crime.  Covered in piss, poo, and only god knows what else, I felt <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Humiliate" data-meaning="(verb) - to cause loss of pride, dignity">humiliated</span>!</p>

        <p>Come to find out, there is a time when a submarine "blows sanitaries", meaning  the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Sewage" data-meaning="(noun) - waste that passes from toilets to sewers">sewage</span> is released from the submarine into the ocean.  Flushing the toilet during this process can break the plumbing system and cause serious problems(luckily for the boat and I, the only <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Consequence" data-meaning="(noun) - result, usually in a negative way">consequence</span> was me having to get hepatitis <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Shot" data-meaning="(noun) - medical injection, vaccination">shots</span> and an iodine shower after)</p>

        <p>Word travels faster than the speed of light on a boat!  Before I left the toilet, I'm pretty sure word <u><strong>had traveled</strong></u> from the torpedo room to the maintenance bay, galley, all the way to the radio room.  After cleaning up I went upstairs to the radio room and reported to my supervisor.  No one could believe what happened to me.  Shock and awe..  I was the first person in  XX years who "blew sans" on himself.  For the next three or four days, I ate in the galley alone.  The crew kept their distance from me...like "social distancing".  Many jokes about it.  They wore gloves around me and eventually I was congratulated by the crew for making history. </p>

        <p>Before we arrived back to Pearl Harbor, everyone <u><strong>had been told</strong></u> the news about my historic moment.  I walked into the shop, jokes <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Galore" data-meaning="(adverb) - in abundance">galore</span>, in excess.  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Relentless" data-meaning="(adjective) - unyielding, persistent">Relentless</span>, endless... I never lived it down.  It gave me fame, publicity..err <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Infamy" data-meaning="(noun) - famous for bad reasons, criminal-like, bad reputation">infamy</span>, a new identity.   The legend grew, along with a few other tall tales.   A new name was soon <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Bestow" data-meaning="(verb) - to present with honor">bestowed</span> upon me</p>
