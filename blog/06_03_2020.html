        <p>The photograph above is <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Empower" data-meaning="(verb) - to enable, to give strength, power">empowering</span> to say the least.  It hypnotized me and left a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Plethora" data-meaning="(noun) - an abundance of something">plethora</span> of questions running through my mind on repeat.  It pushed me to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Reflect" data-meaning="(verb) - to show an image in a mirror)">reflect</span> on who I am, the things I have done, the choices I have made, and why I am who I am now.   What side do you take? Do you <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Align" data-meaning="(verb) - to join with others in a cause">align</span> yourself with a group, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Faction" data-meaning="(noun) - a group or clique">faction</span>, or party based on your <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Principle" data-meaning="(noun) - fundamental doctrine, sense of requirements, rule">principles</span> and values, or <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Lean" data-meaning="(verb) -to bend or incline">lean</span> in another direction because it is the popular, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Hip" data-meaning="(adjective) - trendy">hip</span>, comfortable, easy, or "acceptable" path to follow?</p>

        <p>Time and experience have both taught me that labeling myself, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Affiliate" data-meaning="(verb and noun) -to associate with">affiliating</span> with a specific group or party has <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Stunt" data-meaning="(verb) - stop, slow, hinder the growth">stunted</span> my growth and development in a number of ways.  It's easy to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Fall in" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to form a line behind one another">fall in</span> and feel a sense of belonging, camaraderie, and peace knowing that all of those around you have the same perspectives and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Adhere" data-meaning="(verb) - to stick closely to">adhere</span> to the same rules, a similar way of life. <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Fit in" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to feel like you belong or accepted by a group">Fitting in</span> is the easy way, the comfortable decision.  Sometimes when we attempt to fit in, we <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Compromise" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to make vulnerable or jeopardize">compromise</span> our values and standards, going the wrong way down a one-way street. </p>

        <p>Finding independence and freedom is critical to the development of our minds and to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Achieve" data-meaning="(verb) - to get or attain by effort">achieve</span> success and progress in life.  What is independence and freedom to you?  To me, it means not categorizing myself by saying, "I'm a neo-right-liberal-blah-blah-blah" or "I'm an ultra- conservative, right-wing protestant" and following others because I don't want to think for myself and have my own opinions and ideas.  Being independent to me means thinking for myself and developing my own ideas and opinions without <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="External" data-meaning="(adjective) - the outside of something">external</span> pressure.  Living in a way where I explore all options, opinions, variants, and not letting one person(the manager/controller of a group-who could be a priest, a representative of a party,etc) influence or <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Dictate" data-meaning="(verb) - to give orders, control">dictate</span> my belief system, my codex, my lifestyle.</p>

        <p>How do you find yourself and your identity?  For many, it is not an easy task.  Going through different situations, breaking down those barriers which have been built based on stereotypes, fears, and irrational ideas are great steps in the right direction.  Stop caring about other peoples' opinions, how people might view you, judge you. Start looking in the mirror and caring about what you think of what you do every day, how you live your life, where you are and where you want to be.</p>

        <p>In short</p>

        <p>-<span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Go against the grain " data-meaning="(verb) -to make the more difficult choice, make the unpopular decision">go against the grain </span> if your <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Conscience" data-meaning="(noun) - an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of your behavior">conscience </span> tells you it's not your way(even if it isn't comfortable and the feedback you receive might not be the kindest).</p>

        <p>-own who you are, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Embrace " data-meaning="(verb) - to accept the situation">embrace </span> your personal views, standards, and principles</p>

        <p>-be a wolf, not a sheep(don't follow just because the majority are doing it or because it is trendy)</p>

        <p>-always keep an open mind and don't refuse yourself new experiences and opportunities out of fear, because of stereotypes</p>

        <p>Join the revolt,</p>

        <p><strong>Grammar notes:</strong></p>

        <p>stop+gerund </p>

        <p>stop+gerund= to finish the gerund action</p>

        <p>He stopped eating dinner at midnight</p>

        <p>stop+infinitive=to begin the infinitive action</p>

        <p>He stopped to eat dinner at midnight</p>

        <p>-there was another action happening before the action "eat"</p>

        <p>mean+gerund= in other words/in short</p>

        <p>Independence to me means thinking for myself, setting my rules</p>

        <p>mean+infinitive=my intention</p>

        <p>I mean to wake up every day at 0900</p>

        <p>-your intention doesn't mean that it happens, it can end in failure. </p>

        <p>-context is everything!</p>
