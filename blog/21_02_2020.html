				<p>Yesterday, I had a meeting with a client and the theme we discussed was memories and childhood.  As usual, we <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Went over" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to review">went over</span> vocabulary and some grammar which we then applied to our discussion.  Our memories are not always bright and happy, right?  From time to time those negative experiences can <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Creep back" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to move very quietly, stealthily">creep back</span> from the darkest depths of our minds and put us in a "mood",or even worse, those memories and experiences can influence the way we live our lives today.</p>    

				<p><span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Scar" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a mark left by a healed wound, an after-effect of psychological trauma">Scars</span>-what are scars?  Physical marks on our bodies that tell our histories, tales, and experiences.  Scars can also be mental and emotional.  Those scars <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Linger" data-meaning="(verb) - to stay in place, to be reluctant to leave.  To continue or persist">linger</span> and attack our minds every now and again.   How do you <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Cope with" data-meaning="(verb+preposition) - to take action against difficulties and overcome them">cope with</span> traumatic events from your past?  Do you <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Embrace" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to adopt, to accept willingly">embrace</span> them and find strength in them or do you allow those memories to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Weigh (smbd) down" data-meaning="(verb+preposition) - to burden or immobilize">weigh you down</span> and limit you, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Beat (smbd) up" data-meaning="(verb+preposition) - to physically attack someone, to continually criticise and question yourself">beat you up</span>, and defeat you? </p>  

				<p>I'll share a very personal story about my teenage years.  That period of my life left a deep and painful scar on me for many years until I understood how to approach that trauma and transform it into something which <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Propel" data-meaning="(verb) - to urge onward, to cause to move forward">propelled</span> me to develop, progress, and set a much higher standard for my life!</p>  

				<p>When I was about thirteen, the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Court" data-meaning="(noun) - a judicial assembly">court</span> gave me the option to live with either of my parents(they divorced when I was five years old).  At that age, I was extremely <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Eager" data-meaning=" (adjective) - strong desire or feeling to do something">eager</span> to know who my father was.  I had been living with my mother and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Stepfather" data-meaning="(noun) - the husband of a child's mother through another marriage">stepfather</span> for years and rarely saw, or knew who my dad was.  The years before, I would only see him twice a month, sometimes less.</p>  

				<p>My father was a functional alcoholic.  He spent four to six evenings in the local bar and I was just kind of there.  I had to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Fend for" data-meaning="(verb+preposition) - survive, protect oneself ">fend for</span> myself in many ways.  It wasn't a typical household where you eat dinner together as a family, spend time together, and so on.  Just two people <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Exist" data-meaning="(verb) - to be alive">existing</span> under one roof without much support.   I always had an argument with him about getting new clothes, giving me money for lunch at school, and just simple things a teen needs in general.  He would forget to leave me lunch money, I had to wear his jeans and socks to school,  I would <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="End up" data-meaning="(verb+preposition) - to result in something">end up</span> at school eating a yogurt for lunch because he got drunk and didn't have, or simply just forgot to give me cash for my daily expenses. </p>   

				<p>I took part in the concert band and played the saxophone.  Our uniforms required everyone to be in black shoes.  I did not have any so I went to my father and told him what I needed. His answer-the ones in your closet are fine.  They are "close enough".  They were brown, not black.  I repeatedly told him about the standard for this concert and he refused to take me shopping.  I went to school the next day and told my band teacher Mr. H the dilemma I was having.  He sourced me two left black shoes for the performance, some "extras" that were in storage.  I felt ridiculously embarrassed asking, accepting, and knowing that I was going to have to wear those shoes two evenings later for a performance!</p>  

				<p>Two evenings later, our group was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Rehears" data-meaning="(verb) - to practice, drill, or train(actor, musician, speech, play)">rehearsing</span> for the show in our uniforms.  I was sitting in the front row and Mr. L came in to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Warm up" data-meaning="(verb+preposition) - to prepare for something, gradually increasing the intensity">warm us up</span>.  Mr. L was a real jerk to say the least.  I don't recall anyone who actually like him.  Anyways, he looked at me, down at my feet, and at me again with this nasty, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Malicious" data-meaning="(adjective) - spiteful, intentionally harmful">malicious</span> smile on his face.  He then asked me in front of everyone in the band why I was wearing two left shoes and why I couldn't afford to buy my own.  I remember my ears burning , my heart pounding, and everyone staring at me, feeling judged, and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Ostracize" data-meaning="(verb) - to exclude from society, friendship, to banish">ostracized</span> by everyone in the room.  There were some <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Giggle" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to laugh">giggles</span> and laughs from those around me.  I just recall sinking deeper and deeper into that chair.</p>    

				<p>That situation before the concert set the tone for the next couple of years for me.  I felt lost, hopeless, and alone.  My marks in school became worse, I started <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Skip school" data-meaning="(verb+object) - to pretend to go to school, but in reality, taking part in other activities)">skipping school</span> because I hated the atmosphere, I didn't really have any friends there and felt like an <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Outcast" data-meaning="(noun) - a person who is rejected from society">outcast</span>.  I came very close to not graduating on time.  Luckily, my english teacher, Ms. Lo pulled me aside after class and gave me a choice and a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Lifeline" data-meaning="(noun) - a device with a rope used for saving someone">lifeline</span>.  Due to skipping school, not doing homework, being unmotivated in general, I wasn't going to have enough credits to graduate with my class and I would have to attend one more semester. </p>  

				<p>Having that moment with her woke me up and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Light a fire" data-meaning="(collocation) - to motivate, inspire, encourage">lit a fire</span> inside of me.  I realized that my father wasn't going to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Encourage" data-meaning="(verb) - to stimulate, to inspire with confidence">encourage</span> me, support, me, push me, pay attention to me in any way and I had to take care of myself.  My perspective began to transform.  The mentality that I had, "this is life, it's not going to get better" died and I began to tell myself that I never wanted to feel that way again.   I never wanted to have to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Beg" data-meaning="(verb) - to ask by way of donation ">beg</span> for new clothes or be made fun of again because I was the poor kid. I never wanted to have to be on the street asking for food or money.  I desired change  began to figure out that only I control my destiny.</p>  

				<p>Those things that happen to us can define us in a positive or in a drastically <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Detrimental" data-meaning="(adjective) - harmful, bad for one">detrimental</span> way.  It depends on how we channel those emotions and the actions we take.  I could have chosen to continue living with that mentality where I was the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Victim" data-meaning="(noun) - a person who is deceived, cheated, injured">victim</span> and could do nothing to escape that way of life.  Fortunately I made another decision.  I decided to win, to be the victor, not the beaten, the walked upon, the left behind.   We all have the choice to play the victim, to accept what is now will always be, or we can choose to fight back, take control, and dictate our own lives.</p>    

				<p>I'm thankful that my father has given up his old ways and become a much better person.  I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Harbor" data-meaning="(verb) - to keep or hold">harbor</span> no ill feelings towards him about my upbringing.   It made me who I am today.   I am also extremely grateful for Ms. Lo, who challenged me and cared about me and my future when no one else really did.  She had hundreds of students, but she took the time and energy to push me through that difficult period.  Thank you so much, I'll never forget what you've done for me.</p>
