        <p>Yesterday I went to the gym for the last time until only god knows how long.  The place was a ghost town, but like any <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Decent" data-meaning="(adjective) - respectable">decent</span> human being, I took some <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Precaution" data-meaning="(noun) - a measure taken to avoid a negative outcome">precautions</span> and wore my mask out of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Consideration" data-meaning="(noun) - to keep in mind, thoughtfulness for others">consideration</span> for others.</p>

        <p>I hopped on the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Treadmill" data-meaning="(noun) - a running machine">treadmill</span> after <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Warm up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to slowly elevate your heart rate when before doing strenuous activity">warming up</span> and began my cardio session.  About two kilometers into my run, I felt like I was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Suffocate" data-meaning="(verb) - to impede someone's breathing">suffocating</span>.  My mask was constantly <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Disrupt" data-meaning="(verb) - interrupt ">disrupting</span> my breathing pattern and blocking my nasal passages.  It was uncomfortable to say the least and started <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Sap" data-meaning="(verb) - to slowly drain, remove, extract">sapping</span> my energy and motivation.  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Breath" data-meaning="(verb) - to take oxygen, inhale and exhale">Breathing</span> through my mouth was even worse!  I nearly <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Swallow" data-meaning="(verb) - to take into your stomach through your mouth">swallowed</span> my mask while <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Gasp" data-meaning="(verb) - to struggle for breath">gasping</span> for air(I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Give up" data-meaning="(verb) - to quit">gave up</span> on that running idea shortly after and hit the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Weight" data-meaning="(noun) - plate, dumbbells, etc which are used in a gym">weights</span>).</p>

                <br />
                fresh out of boot camp</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>Running on the treadmill <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Bring back" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - return ">brought back</span> memories of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Bootcamp" data-meaning="(noun) - basic training for military service">bootcamp</span>.  What a time I'll never forget!  It has been about nineteen years since I <u><strong>was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Hurry off" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to rush">hurried off</span></strong></u> of a bus at Great Lakes Training Center in Illinois and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Thrown into the fir" data-meaning="(idiom) - to forcefully put someone in an unexpected condition or situation">thrown into the fire</span>.  So many situations, events,  experiences during that nine weeks that <u><strong>have been <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Etch" data-meaning="(verb) - to fix permanently">etched</span></strong></u> into my mind for <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Eternity" data-meaning="(noun) - forever">eternity</span>.</p>

        <p>Two <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Vivid" data-meaning="(adjective) - distinct, clear bright mental image">vivid</span> and nostalgic moments came to mind yesterday.  The first row was getting gassed.  The gas chamber.  OH.....MY.....GOD!  The <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Buildup" data-meaning="(noun) - the accumulation of something over a period of time">buildup</span> to that "exercise" was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Tormenting" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - mental or physical suffering">tormenting</span>, frightening, panic attack-inducing!  So many questions and not many answers.  Every <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Division" data-meaning="(noun) - a number of service members under one command">division</span> has that one guy who is <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Set back" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to delay">set back</span> a week or two and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Know the ropes" data-meaning="(idiom) - to be familiar with the details or knowhow about a job, role, situation">"knows the ropes"</span>.  I remember this guy <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Spread" data-meaning="(verb) - to extend, stretch over an area, to pass">spreading</span> legendary s*#! about the gas chamber and most of us <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="buy into" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to believe">bought into</span> what he was saying.  The majority of us were fresh out of high school, 18-20 years old I'd say.  Fresh meat, naive, and clueless sums us up as a whole pretty well.  Our RDCs(meaning instructors) were also <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Sow" data-meaning="(verb) - to plant">sowing</span> seeds of fear and doom into our minds.  They were overly effective with that stuff.  They must have worked in psy-ops before becoming RDCs</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Gas chamber day</strong></p>

        <p>We <u><strong>were marched</strong></u> as a division to this room, practiced putting on and securing our masks, making sure there were no <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Leak" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - gas, liquid, light, etc escape through an unintended hole">leaks</span>, everything <u><strong>was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Seal" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to close">sealed</span></strong></u>.  We <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="File in" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to enter/make a line in an organized manner">filed in</span> to this room.  The smell I remember now is so <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Distinct" data-meaning="(adjective) - specific">distinct</span>, but impossible to describe.  It was sour, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Pungent" data-meaning="(adjective) - a penetrating sharp smell">pungent</span>, spicy...I don't even know.  We <u><strong>were organized</strong></u> into rows and columns about twenty people deep if I recall correctly.  We <u><strong>were given</strong></u> directions to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Put on" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to dress ">put on</span> our masks and await further orders.  Once I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Tighten" data-meaning="(verb) - to make closer, fitted">tightened</span> the mask, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Fasten" data-meaning="(verb) - secure">fastened</span> the straps, and began breathing, I became a bit panicky.  I was in the fourth or fifth row and couldn't really understand what was being said in the front of the room.  The guy next to me looked at me and I him.  We were in the same position.  We couldn't <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Make out" data-meaning="(verb) - to be able to see, hear, or distinguish something clearly">make out</span> what was going on, but we saw people taking their masks off and we <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Follow suit" data-meaning="(collocation) - to do the same">followed suit</span>.  Next thing you know, the instructor began screaming at my battle buddy and I because we hadn't  understood.  We <u><strong>hadn't been told</strong></u> to remove our masks.  Only the first row <u><strong>was given</strong></u> that instruction.  As punishment for our "lack of attention to detail", we <u><strong>were forced</strong></u> to do jumping jacks, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Pushup" data-meaning="(noun) - an exercise for developing arm and chest muscles">pushups</span>, and other physical exercises while <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Get used to" data-meaning="(collocation) - to become habitual">"getting used to"</span> the C.S. gas.  It probably only lasted 4-5 minutes, but felt endless .  For us, it truly lasted forever because we also <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Participate" data-meaning="(verb) - to be active or involved">participated</span> with the second, third, and fourth rows.  It was terrible, torturous!  I remember my eyes watering, burning, felt like they were on fire.  Imagine someone pouring red chili pepper juice into your eyes.  My throat felt like it was closing off, constant coughing, and stuff <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Drain" data-meaning="(verb) - to empty">draining</span> out of my nose.  It wasn't the usual <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Junk" data-meaning="(noun) - useless stuff, garbage">junk</span> that comes out of your nose when you blow it.  It was white, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Clumpy" data-meaning="(adjective) - a thick grouping, clustered">clumpy</span>, and hard as a rock.  We were ordered out of the room and to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Wash up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to clean">wash up</span>. We made it outside and SANITIZED!  I thoroughly <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Scrub" data-meaning="(verb) - vigorously wash">scrubbed</span> my hands, washed my face and started to gain control of my breathing again.  The coughing had about ceased at this point.  That smell though...that smell <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Linger" data-meaning="(verb) - to stay in a place">lingered</span> in the open air and I remember washing my <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Dungarees" data-meaning="(noun) - pants made of strong denim">dungarees</span> ten times over in the barracks.  The aroma of the gas chamber haunt(verb-to recur or visit again) us all for the remainder of bootcamp and still, to this day I will never forget.</p>

        <p>Battle stations is on my mind now.  Check back in a couple of days for part two of this saga,</p>

        <p><strong>Take note of the underlined words above</strong></p>

        <p>-only the first row was given that instruction</p>

        <p>-this is an example of passive voice in past simple tense.  We modify the form of to be to designate what tense we are using and always follow up with the third form of the verb</p>

        <p>to be+3rd form is the base construction for passive voice in simple tenses</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>past simple=was/were+3rd form</strong></p>
        <p><strong>present perfect=have/has+been+3rd form</strong></p>
        <p>-rather than using a general subject+verb statement (active voice), we use object+to be+3rd form
            to emphasize the action over the subject</p>

        <p>-if the action is more important than the subject, use passive voice</p>

        <p>-if you subject is more important than the action, use active voice</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>There are a few other reasons for using passive voice and other constructions.  Provided that you have any questions, get ahold of me and I'll be happy to schedule a meeting with you!  See you soon!</strong></p>
