        <p>I am very much <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Look forward to" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to be excited about something in the future">looking forward to</span>  the next few months!  I have so many plans for traveling, friends from the USA visiting, and something epic that everyone will be able to watch from the comfort of their homes, broadcast on their televisions in the very near future!  I can't say much about it due to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="disclosure " data-meaning="(noun) - the act of making something known">disclosure</span> forms and whatnot, but it is going to be a unique, and cool experience to say the least!  So many things are happening in the next months, it makes it hard to believe that everything will go according to plan.</p>

        <p>April is going to be insane!  We are spending the first week of April in Hanoi.  A friend is flying in from the USA and we are <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Plan on" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to plan ">planning on</span> <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Check out" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to watch, look, see, or experience something">checking out</span>  the Formula 1 race.  I've never been to a race like that.  It's going to be awesome!  A few days after, other friends from the USA are visiting for two weeks.  We plan to take them on a tour of southern and central Vietnam.  Currently, we are planning a route from our city, to the north, and back again.   Many details are involved in this.  We haven't visited the north yet, so we are doing some research, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="figure out" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to understand or solve something">figuring out</span>  where we are going to be on which dates, in order to book our <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Accommodations" data-meaning="(noun) - food and lodging">accommodations</span> .</p>

        <p>Over the years, I have told myself that I would do many things, "planned things out" but did not do what I said I was going to do.  I've definitely learned from those situations, and the feelings of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Disappointment" data-meaning="(noun) - feeling of dissatisfaction after failure or when expectations, hopes do not manifest">disappointment</span> in the end when it did not happen.  What have I done to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Reduce" data-meaning="(verb) - to make smaller">reduce</span>  the risk of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Failure" data-meaning="(noun) - to not succeed">failure</span>  and have more success in <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Execute" data-meaning="(verb) - to carry out, perform, do">executing</span> my actions living a more <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Rewarding" data-meaning="(adjective) - providing satisfaction, achievements">rewarding</span>  life? </p>


        <p> 1. Setting realistic, clear, and achievable goals.  Make a short-term plan/long-term plan detailing how you will achieve this.  Also, having goals which align with my values and standards.  It is <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Excruciatingly" data-meaning="(adverb) - painfully">excruciatingly</span>
            difficult to hit your targets if you don't have the motivation, energy, and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Enthusiasm" data-meaning="(noun) - intense emotional energy for something">enthusiasm</span> for them</p>

        <p> 2. Taking <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Ownership" data-meaning="(noun) - possession">ownership</span> of my words and actions.  If you say you are going to do something, do it. Don't talk about doing something because it "sounds cool", it's the "popular thing", it's what someone wants to hear,  and so on.  Be a doer, not a sayer. </p>

        <p> 3. Giving myself deadlines!  Having goals without deadlines is a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Trap" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a mechanical device used to catch something">trap</span> . Not having a deadline <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Enable" data-meaning="(verb) - to give power, ability">enables</span> a person to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Procrastinate" data-meaning="(verb) - to delay">procrastinate</span> and push that goal back again and again.  You must be able to see the finish line(noun-the end of a race)!</p>

        <p>Before moving to Vietnam, many people were overly enthusiastic and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Adamant" data-meaning="(adjective) - stubborn, unyielding, persistent">adamant</span> about visiting us after we had relocated.  Ninety-five percent of those people have pushed those plans back, cancelled, or <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Come up with" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - create">come up with</span>  reasons why they can't come.  Changing your perspective a bit, following those three steps listed above,  having more <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Willpower" data-meaning="(noun) - control of one's actions, impulses">willpower</span> , and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Get rid of" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - remove, destroy, throw out">getting rid of</span> the word "can't" will help to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Liberate" data-meaning="(verb) - to give freedom)">liberate</span>  you and provide new experiences and opportunities for you in the future!  </p>
        <p>Remember, take action. Don't talk about taking action,</p>

        <p><strong>Grammar notes</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Gerunds</strong> - what is it and when to use?</p>

        <p>A gerund is the verb+ing :</p>

        <p>to set=setting</p>

        <p>to take=taking</p>

        <p>to give=giving</p>

        <p>A gerund acts as a subject/object of a sentence when one is needed.  If you scroll up and look at the three steps, you will see that i began each with a gerund.  We cannot begin a statement/answer with a verb.  You can only begin a question or a command with a verb. </p>

        <p><strong>Plan on + gerund VS. plan + to infinitive</strong></p>

        <p>Why do we use a gerund after plan on, but  "to infinitive"  after plan?</p>

        <p>- after a preposition, we use nouns/gerunds</p>

        <p>- after the verb plan, if we want to use another verb, it must be in infinitive form (certain list of verbs+infinitive)</p>

        <p>There are many more reasons we use gerunds and infinitives.  You can check out my videos and find some more help as well as schedule a meeting with me to improve your grammar and English skills!</p>
