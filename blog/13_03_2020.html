        <p>How do you <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Measure" data-meaning="(verb) -to define the quality or quantity of something">measure</span> your success, development and progress the things you do?  How do you define success?  There are an <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Infinite" data-meaning="(adjective) - unlimited, endless">infinite</span> number of answers to this question due to cultural differences, the ways we were <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Bring up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to care for a child until he/she becomes an adult">brought up</span>,  different <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Generation" data-meaning="(noun) - a group of individuals born in the same era">generations</span> and more.  I had a lengthy discussion with a client of mine today and I'm sure we could have gone on talking about it for hours. Our talk <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Stir up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to cause to feel strong emotion">stirred up</span> some memories of my grandfather and his version of success.</p>

        <p>I remember my grandfather telling me that I needed to work more, work hard.  A hard-working man is a successful man.  My grandpa <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Grow up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to mature, from baby to adult">grew up</span> <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Labor" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - work">laboring</span> on a celery farm and then running the farms after serving in the army during the Korean War.  Al and I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="See eye-to-eye" data-meaning="(idiom) -to understand each other">saw eye-to-eye</span> on many things due to our military experiences(No one else in the family served besides us).  We also disagreed on things such as what success means because of our generation gap.  We had many talks about it, arguments to be more specific.  He would <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Scold" data-meaning="(verb) - to find fault, to lecture">scold</span> me for "wasting my money" on plane tickets, traveling, and other things rather than saving for the future.  This theme became a constant over the years.  Every time I visited "home", I would get the same lecture about how I'm living my life abroad, wasting away, and so on.  I gained the skill of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Selective hearing" data-meaning="(noun) - to filter/hear what you want to hear">"selective hearing"</span> as a result of those talks....learning to filter that negativity out.   I learned so much from my grandfather over the years(not only selective hearing).  I understood what respect was at a very young age because of the man he was.  Responsibility and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Accountability" data-meaning="(noun) - to be liable">accountability</span> for my actions.</p>



        <p>A couple of months before he <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Pass away" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to die">passed away</span>, I flew home to visit him because I knew that time was short.  He was quite ill, becoming weaker and weaker.  Our last moments together were spent discussing our times in the military, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Recalling" data-meaning="(verb) - remember">recalling</span> ice-fishing adventures, rides on the lawnmower, cruising around in one of his antique cars, and summers at the pool.  There were some souvenirs on a table in living room.  A plate with Peter the Great on a horse resting on a side table next to some photos of his grandkids.  He pointed at it asking me who that was, the history of Russia, questions about life in Russia, why I decided to move there.  He was extremely <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Curious" data-meaning="(adjective) - eager to know, inquisitive">curious</span> to know more about the places I've visited.  We talked about my travels in Europe, different places I've been in Russia.  We took a look at some photographs on my phone.  After describing things in detail, telling him about some of the amazing places I've been, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Ancient" data-meaning="(adjective) - very old">ancient</span> and historic sites I've visited, he then looked at me and said,</p>

            <img alt="Me and Grandpa" src="./img/13_03_2020_1.jpg" width="400px">
        </div>

        <p>"Wow Josh, You have been all over the world and had so many different experiences! I wish I had traveled more.  You were right all along."</p>

        <p>In that moment, I understood that Big Al finally got me and viewed me in a successful way, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Approve" data-meaning="(verb) - to think or speak favorably of">approved</span> of my "life investment", accepted my path.  It made me tear up and we shared a big, long hug.  The last hug I would ever have with him, the last moments we would share together. </p>

        <p>Success! <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Mutual" data-meaning="(adjective) - having the same relation towards something">Mutual</span> understanding on this one issue that used to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Drive" data-meaning="(verb) - to place between with force">drive</span> a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Wedge" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - an object used to divide something">wedge</span> between us.  </p>

        <br />

        <p>My version of success:</p>

        <p>Finding the balance between work and play(that could mean traveling, relaxing, partying, etc).  Doing something that I love to do and am passionate about.  Having a job that I enjoy is success from my point of view.  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Confine" data-meaning="(verb) -to trap, restrict ">Confining</span> myself to a 9-5 job and being <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Tether" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a chain used to restrict movement">tethered</span> to a place(a city in this case) because I "have to" report to an office, factory, etc five days a week is not a successful way of life(unless of course that was my passion).  For some people, a 9-5 is success.  Their passion is to work on projects with a collective and develop programs, or work on a team and create something new.  </p>

        <p>What is success to you?  I'd love to hear your opinion on this. Get ahold of me and let me know!</p>

        <p>Missing you every day grandpa, thank you for all of your life lessons,</p>

        <p><i>Josh</i></p>
