				<i>(Hint: click the word to see the translation)</i>

				<p>One of the reasons I started this blog is to share my traveling experiences and to show people that there is another world out there, outside of the microscopic and comfortable bubble we call "home".  Traveling has done so much for me!  It has destroyed some silly stereotypes which were <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Embed" data-meaning="(verb) - to become fixed, immobile, unmovable)">embedded</span> in my mind at a young age.  I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="firmly" data-meaning="(adverb) - strongly">firmly</span> believe that we all need to travel and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="take in" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to absorb, adapt">take in</span> new cultures, perspectives, and places in order to broaden our views on life, in turn making us more accepting, understanding of others, and tolerant of things and ways which we define as not "the norm". </p>

				<p>My first experience abroad was when I was nineteen (I do not count Canada as traveling abroad, I'm from Michigan).  I joined the Navy at the age of eighteen and one of the first things I was given upon showing up to my duty station at Pearl Harbor Hawaii was a passport.  I didn't understand the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Significance" data-meaning="(noun) - importance">significance</span>, the power of that little, blue book at that time, or what it would do for me in the years to come!  A passport is a skeleton key.  It opens hundreds of doors and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Endless" data-meaning="(adjective) -without end, continuous">endless</span> opportunities.  As an American, it is one of the best investments you can make!  Fact:  US citizens with an American passport can travel to 116 countries with no visa, get a visa upon arrival in 47 countries, and 34 countries demand a visa before arriving.  A US passport is an extremely powerful tool indeed!</p>

				</div>

				<p>I'll never forget <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Touch down" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) -an aircraft lands, touches the earth">touching down</span> at Narita International Airport for the first time(of many).   To say that everything felt <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Foreign" data-meaning="(adjective) - from another country, strange, not local">"foreign"</span> is an understatement to say the least.  I remember riding in a taxi on the wrong side of the road(one of my ridiculous standards, the right side is always the right way!).  I'll never forget the sensory <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Foreign" data-meaning="(verb) -to load in excess">overload</span> while walking through downtown Tokyo at night!  The movie Bladerunner comes to mind for whatever reason.  I remember feeling the warmth and radiance of the glowing, neon <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Tube" data-meaning="(noun) - cylindrical lamp">tubes</span> stimulating my <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Receptors" data-meaning="(noun) - sensory agents stimulated by heat, touch, sound, etc">receptors</span>, and putting me in a dream-like state.  I was in awe of everything around me. It was the year 2001, but it looked like I had taken a time machine a century or so into the future. </p> 

				<p>Trying habu sake for the first time!  Rice wine with a dead snake <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Coil" data-meaning="(noun/verb) -to wind into rings">coiled</span> up in the jar, mouth <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Agape" data-meaning="(adjective) -to be open">agape</span>, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Fangs" data-meaning="(noun) - sharp teeth">fangs</span> <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Protrude" data-meaning="(verb) -to project forward">protruding</span>.  Staring at this dead reptile while kicking back shots of "it", a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Haze" data-meaning="(noun) -vagueness, obscurity">haze</span> coming over me, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Dulling" data-meaning="(adjective) -not bright or clear">dulling</span> my vision, I felt the need to go to the toilet.  That snake juice did not want to stay in my stomach.  Upon entering the toilet, all I found was a hole in the ground, a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Porcelain" data-meaning="(noun) - ceramic material">porcelain</span>hole.  I was puzzled.  How was I supposed to navigate this, deal with this in my current state?  Only one way to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Find out" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) -to get the answer">find out</span>.  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Squat" data-meaning="(noun/verb) -to sit in a crouching position">Squat</span>...  I'll <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Spare" data-meaning="(verb) -to avoid harming or destroying">spare</span> you the details.  It was messy...</p>

				<p>Japan is unique for so many reasons.  Gaming culture is huge there!  Mega arcades, crazy game concepts that we can't even imagine in the west were all over the place.  I even watched a Street Fighter tournament in some kind of arena/stadium as a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Spectator" data-meaning="(noun) - an observer, someone who watches an event">spectator</span> sport. E-sports in Japan started long before what we know as E-sports today.</p>   

				<p>In Japan, a celebrity doesn't have to be human.  A celebrity could be an anime/manga character who  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Endorse" data-meaning="(verb) - to support or sponsor">endorses</span> a product.  I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Recall" data-meaning="(verb) - remember">recall</span> seeing Cloud Strife on the side of a bus sponsoring a car brand.  Anime pop stars who sing songs are sometimes more popular than real musicians.  Speaking of singing, karaoke is king in Japan!  Skyscrapers littered with soundproof rooms for you and your friends to sing away and party late into the night....or morning.  Food,drink menus, a phone to order whatever you want, and a mic in your hand.  No <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="shame" data-meaning="(noun/verb) -disgrace, dishonor, embarrassment">shame</span> in singing in the privacy of your own company.</p>

				<p>From the food to the nature, to the entertainment, the mentality of the people, Japan is a remarkable place.  It is hard to compare anything in Japan to another country I have visited.  Due to Japan being an island nation, it is easier for them to protect their culture, traditions, and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Heritage" data-meaning="(noun) - something handed down to future generations, tradition">heritage</span>.  It truly is another planet.  I've visited there a number of times and I've only had wonderful impressions.  I am <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Looking forward to" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to feel pleased and excited about something that is going to happen">looking forward to</span> visiting with my wife during cherry blossom season in the next year or two.</p> 

				<p>Destination:  Kyoto</p>

				<p>I've traveled to many countries over the years.  Every country is a unique and an experience of discovery.  The decision to join the military and travel to so many countries by the time I was 22 years old exposed me to the world in an absolutely different way.  If I hadn't done that, what would I have learned, what would I have done in life?  Who would I be now?  I'd probably be a person with a linear, and limited perspective who would fear anything which wasn't <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Habitual" data-meaning="(adjective) - something which happens consistently, a pattern">habitual</span> or "normal".  I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Urge" data-meaning="(noun/verb) - to push, to motivate, encourage">urge</span> everyone to cross borders, to  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Venture" data-meaning="(verb) - to take risk">venture</span> out, explore the world, and find yourself.  No <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Border" data-meaning="(noun/verb) - the line which separates a country, state, province">borders</span> means no limits.  </p>

				<p>What do you fear? </p> 

				<p>What stereotypes are holding you back from new experiences and having a fresh perspective?</p> 

				<p><strong>A world where we all understand, accept, and tolerate each other better would be a more peaceful, safer, and happier place for us all. One love.</strong></p>


				<h3>Pay attention to these constructions:</h3>

				<p>remember+gerund=past memory </p>

				<p>I remember walking through the Shinjuku district in Tokyo in 2010</p>

				<p>-even though remember is used in present simple, the gerund changes the meaning</p>

				<p>remember+infinitive=direct meaning</p>

				<p>I remembered to do my homework</p>

				<p>-it means I did it/didn't forget to do it.  No reference of memory/nostalgia here</p>
