        <p>If you <strong><u>haven't read</u></strong> my blog about my gas chamber experience in bootcamp,  take a look at that first! I've been wearing a mask in public for the past two weeks or so.  It isn't always comfortable, but it is necessary in this era.  Many people however, laugh it off, make a mockery of those who wear masks, and take precautions.  The mask <strong><u>has become</u></strong> a part of me.  The group of people who <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Ridicule" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to make fun of">ridicule</span> those who wear masks are mostly <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Foreigner" data-meaning="(noun) - a person not native to the country he/she is in">foreigners</span> here who <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Claim" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to state or assert">claim</span> that it will not protect you, it is useless.  Those foreigners <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Exacerbate" data-meaning="(verb) - to worsen">exacerbate</span> the issues we are already dealing with.  As <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Expat" data-meaning="(noun) - a person who lives outside his/her country of citizenship">expat</span>, we are viewed as a problem, carriers of the virus (as I mentioned in a previous blog).  By not wearing a mask, we are <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Solidify" data-meaning="(verb) - to make stronger, to make concrete">solidifying</span> this stereotype and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Enforce" data-meaning="(verb) - to strengthen">enforcing</span> the discrimination which we are up against.</p>

        <p>The idea of the mask is to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Prevent" data-meaning="(verb) - to protect and defend">prevent</span> yourself from <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Transmit" data-meaning="(verb) - to pass or spread ">transmitting</span> bacterias/viruses to others by coughing and spreading the virus amongst the population.   The government <strong><u>has also introduced</u></strong> a new law.  Everyone must wear a mask in public places!  It is the law now, but many foreigners have decided it's not worth following the law.  The <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Arrogance" data-meaning="(noun) - an offensive display of superiority, pride, or self-importance">arrogance</span>, the ignorance, the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Foolery" data-meaning="(noun) - stupidity ">foolery</span> of people.  We are guests in this country!  Respect the local rules and culture.  Adapt to where you live as an expat, you can't expect the country to adapt to you.  It makes me <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Livid" data-meaning="(adjectiv) - furious, angry">livid</span> to see people <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Behave" data-meaning="(verb) - to act in a specific manner">behave</span> in such a way and paranoid about where I live.  I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Reside" data-meaning="(verb) - to dwell, live">reside</span> in a living complex which is <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Saturate" data-meaning="(verb) - an abundance of something">saturated</span> with foreigners and some locals mixed in.  Americans, Brits, Italians, Africans, Indians, Georgians,etc.  You name it, they are probably here. Staying away and in my flat as much as possible!</p>

        <p>Ok...now that I've <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Rant and rave" data-meaning="(phrase) - to speak or write in an emotional or angry manner">ranted and raved</span>, lets travel back in time to my last days of bootcamp.  Our final "test" of bootcamp was called Battle stations.  It was something that we, as a unit were working towards from Day 1.  Seven weeks of being <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Break down" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to take apart piece by piece">broken down</span> mentally and physically.  RDC's <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Instill" data-meaning="(verb) - to inject, infuse ">instilling</span> discipline, organization, respect, and attention to detail into our minds.  That whole process from beginning to end was intense. P-Days to Battle stations(P-Days) is another story for another day.  From how we had to make our beds, locker and uniform inspections, marching.  At the time, those "events" seemed so useless, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Senseless" data-meaning="(adjective) - without meaning or sense">senseless</span>, but come Battle stations....the new me.  The me who was no longer <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Timid" data-meaning="(adjective) - shy, scared, embarrassed">timid</span>, afraid of "what's next".  This me was someone who was ready to face <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Adversity" data-meaning="(noun) - problems,challenges, obstacles">senseless</span>, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Take on" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to accept or absorb">take on</span> new challenges, and do whatever had to be done.  I was reprogrammed, reborn in some ways.</p>

        <p><strong>Battle stations</strong></p>

        <p>The day before Battle stations, we were told to rest, sleep, and have our things ready.  We had only been sleeping 6 hours max a night up to that point, less if you had a two-hour guard duty(called a watch, 0000-0200 was the worst!)  Anyways, it was maybe 1400 and we were told to go to sleep.  I don't really remember sleeping.  I only remember staring at the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Bunk" data-meaning="(noun) - a basic stacked bed">bunk</span> above me <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Anticipate" data-meaning="(verb) - to expect">anticipating</span> what was to come.  This moment, the final test was about to arrive!  I was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Restless" data-meaning="(adjective) - uneasy, nervous, overly active">restless</span> my mind racing.  Trying to mentally prepare for the end of this and graduate from bootcamp. Envisioning how this would all unfold, what I would have to go through, all of the stories I had heard about Battle stations from our instructors and the "holdbacks" All of a sudden, alarms went off! Our instructors <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Barge" data-meaning="(verb) - to enter by force">barged</span> into our bay and ordered us to put on our uniforms on, don our gas masks, and form up.  We were led outside for what would be one of many runs in full kit, gas masks strapped to our <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Dome" data-meaning="(noun) - slang for head">domes</span>.</p>

        <p>The next 24 hours was a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Blur" data-meaning="(noun) - not distinct or clear">blur</span>.  I remember jumping off a high dive in my uniform, making a life jacket out of it, and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Board" data-meaning="(verb) - to enter a ship">boarding</span> an emergency raft in the pool, all the while divers pulling at my legs, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Throw off" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to confuse, distract, or disrupt">throwing me off</span> from my task at hand.  I recall running at <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Dusk" data-meaning="(noun) - the period of time between daylight and darkness near sunset">dusk</span> with those heavy-ass boots on, sucking for air, and the stench of my uniform due to the sweat and dirt which had more or less formed a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Symbiotic" data-meaning="(adjective) - having an interdependent relationship">symbiotic</span> relationship with each other over the previous seven weeks(those uniforms were thrown out after bootcamp). The running was brutal.  The mask <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Asphyxiate" data-meaning="(verb) - choke, suffocate">asphyxiating</span> me more and more with every step, at the same time we were singing a cadence.  There were times when we were allowed to remove it.  I can only think back on one other time in my life when the air felt fresher than it did during this "exercise"(that was after 119 days on a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Submarine" data-meaning="(noun) - an underwater vehicle">submarine</span> with very little to no fresh air.  Those first breaths while docking in Bahrain were glorious!) </p>

        <p>Some other <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Hazy" data-meaning="(adjective) - unclear, to have gaps in your memory">hazy</span> memories from that night........carrying a "battle buddy" on a stretcher through some crazy obstacle course in the dark.  Barbed wire, razor wire, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Hoist" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to lift"> hoisting</span> him over walls, through tunnels, etc. I'm pretty sure that drill was to focus on our communication skills while being <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Deafen" data-meaning="(verb) - to lose the power of hearing">deafened</span> by speakers <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="blare" data-meaning="(verb) - to emit a loud noise">blaring</span> simulated explosions, alarms, automatic fire, and more.</p>

        <p>At last, morning came. Dawn was upon us.  The finish line was so close.  We all knew it, we felt it, and were feeding of of each others energy and motivation at this point.  By this time, we had become <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Automate" data-meaning="(verb) -to do without thinking, to be preprogrammed">automated</span> in our actions.  Reflexive, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Numb" data-meaning="(adjective) - without feeling">numb</span> to the tiredness, the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Ache" data-meaning="(noun) - uncomfortable physical feelings">aches</span> and pains in our legs and knees.  Hyper-focused and hungry for victory.  We entered a room where some kind of ceremony began taking place.  We were all given NAVY hats, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Discard" data-meaning="(verb) - to throw away">discarding</span> the RECRUIT hats which  had labeled us for the previous two months.  The national anthem started.  We all saluted the flag, a few tears rolled down my face.  I remember feeling embarrassed, crying in a room full of guys, but I knew we were all feeling that same high.  Up to that point in my life, bootcamp was the most challenging event I had gone through.  It gave me a new sense of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Pride" data-meaning="(noun) - feeling of satisfaction">pride</span>, confidence, and respect for myself and my brothers around me.  We did it together.  Teamwork, hard work, discipline, and accountability.  This event set the stage for what was to come in the following years.  This was only the beginning of it all.....</p>
