        <i>(Hint: click the word to see the translation)</i>
        <p>Not long ago I wrote a piece on our future plans and how many things I am looking forward to experiencing this year.  Three weeks ago, I was filled with emotion!  I was <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Thrill" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a feeling of emotion, excitement">thrilled</span> and impatient about what was to come. Yesterday evening I had a look at that list and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Cross out" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to remove from a list)">crossed out</span> everything on it.  From Elena's birthday trip to Phu Quoc(which should be happening on Monday), to relocating to Bali, and the filming of this TV show(it is still going to happen, just delayed a month or so).  Everything has been either <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Call off" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to cancel">called off</span> or <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Push back" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to cancel">pushed back</span> until further notice.   For a few, it <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Take the wind out of my sails" data-meaning="(idiom) - to make feel less confident or determined">took the wind out of my sails</span>, mentally.</p>

        <p>Life is wild, life is unpredictable.   Three weeks ago, I couldn't imagine as like we are now.  Bars, cinemas, karaoke joints(extremely popular amongst the locals. <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Not my cup of tea" data-meaning="(idiom) - someone one prefers cares about, desires">Not my cup of tea</span> places where people go to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Mingle" data-meaning="(verb) - to associate or mix in company">mingle</span> have closed their doors at least <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Temporarily" data-meaning="(adverb) - lasting for a period of time">temporarily</span>, if not <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Permanently" data-meaning="(adverb) - everlasting, forever">permanently</span>. I've been <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Restrict" data-meaning="(verb) - limit, confine">restricted</span> to my flat more or less.  I only go out to get food, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Supply" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - a quantity of something for use">supplies</span> and necessary items.  I wear a mask everywhere I go, I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Thoroughly" data-meaning="(adverb) - carefully">thoroughly</span> wash my hands more often than Howie Mandel does,  I wash my keys, handles on bags, my building card, my sunglasses every time I come home.  It sounds crazy, but Howie.....that guy is right!  We all need to take some <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="preventative measures" data-meaning="(adj + noun) - steps to protect against something">preventative measures</span> at this time to help <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Reduce" data-meaning="(verb) - decrease">reduce</span> the <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Spreading" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to stretch, open, extend">spreading</span> of this infection.  People say masks don't help.  That is a myth.  You feel stupid wearing one?  You would probably be quite upset if you found out that you contracted the virus through someone who hadn't been wearing a mask.  Everyone needs to get on the same page and do the right thing.  If we aren't all acting accordingly, this problem will <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Flare up" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to burst quickly, especially after disappearing, reducing">flare up</span> time and time again, resetting the progress  we have made!</p>

            <p style="text-align:right"><strong>Us bold brothers stick together</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>Other changes......the locals have started to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Treat" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to act or behave in a certain way">treat</span> us foreigners(white people to be more specific) differently.  I can only recall a few times in my life where I have felt so <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Judge" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to be evaluated, assessed, labeled">judged</span>, been <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Deny" data-meaning="(verb) - refuse, reject">denied</span> services, entry to places because of my skin color.  Many locals(of course not all) here now believe that white people are the main cause of the virus in Vietnam.  To be fair, they have a right to behave this way to a certain degree.  Vietnam <strong><u>had been</u></strong> very well <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Contain" data-meaning="(verb) - to hold">contained</span> until one Vietnamese person came back from Italy or France and a few Europeans entered the country <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Aware of" data-meaning="(collocation) - to be conscious of, have knowledge of">aware of</span> the fact that they <strong><u>had gotten</u></strong> the virus(this is rumored, I cannot <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Verify" data-meaning="(verb) - confirm">verify</span> at this time)!  What a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Selfish" data-meaning="(adjective) - concerned with yourself and lack of care for others">selfish</span>, <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Careless" data-meaning="(adjective) - irresponsible, lack of consideration">careless</span> act against us all.  Since those people have come across the border, the numbers have risen from about 30 to almost 100.  The <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Blame" data-meaning="(noun and verb) - to find fault, to place responsibility">blame</span> cannot be<span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Solely" data-meaning="(adverb) - singularly, alone">solely</span> placed on them, but they did <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Contribute" data-meaning="(verb) - to give, support, promote">contribute</span>  <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Immensely" data-meaning="(adverb) - great size, extent, scope or consequence">immensely</span> to the to the global problem we are up against.   I was in an elevator yesterday.  It stopped on the floor before me and a group of locals were waiting.  They stared at me, I looked at them(with masks on mind you), it felt like a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Standoff" data-meaning="(noun) - a standstill">standoff</span>, high noon.  They just stood there, frozen.  The door closed and I continued down the shaft <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="On my own" data-meaning="(collocation) - by oneself, on your own">on my own</span>.  Out of caution, out of fear, xenophobia, who knows.  It's hard to read people at the moment because we are all wearing masks(at least the considerate ones).  Reading eyes is much more difficult.  Posture and body language tell a lot though.  On a number of occasions, a local has turned his/her back to me in a public place(but treat another locals in a much more <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Approachable" data-meaning="(adjective) - accessible, easy to talk or deal with">approachable</span> manner).
            Parents take their children and shield them from me.  I feel like a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Cancer" data-meaning="(noun) - a disease, something regarded as harmful">cancer</span>, a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Plague" data-meaning="(noun) - a highly infectious disease">plague</span>, a <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Parasite" data-meaning="(noun) - an organism which lives and feeds on another species causing harm">parasite</span>.  I feel so unwelcomed at times.  I don't let it make me angry. I don't <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Retaliate" data-meaning="(verb) - to do something in response">retaliate</span>. I <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Absorb" data-meaning="(verb) - to consume, to take in">absorb</span> the mental blow and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Put up with" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to tolerate, cope with">put up with</span> it with the current situation.  I have a great deal of <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Empathy" data-meaning="(noun) - ability to imagine yourself in the condition or state of another's emotions, feelings">empathy</span> and am an understanding person.  Tolerance will always <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Overcome" data-meaning="(verb) - to deal with successfully">overcome</span> and defeat hatred in the end.</p>

        <p>I attempted to order flowers for my wife for a holiday.  My Vietnamese friend ordered them(in his language).  Twenty minutes later I was back in my flat and the flower company called my phone. I picked up the phone and said, "Hello".  Click.... silence.   I tried calling back to no avail.  A few minutes later I received a message saying, "cancelled, you are a foreigner".  I was taken aback.   At first I felt <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Insult" data-meaning="(verb) - to offend, demean">insulted</span>and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Disrespect" data-meaning="(verb) - to lack respect for others">disrespected</span>.  It took me a bit to <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Get over" data-meaning="(phrasal verb) - to forget about">get over</span> it.  I called another flower company which was more than happy to help me out!  Problem solved.  Carry on sergeant.  Suck it up.</p>

        <p>It's been one hell of a month here. I'm learning a lot about how minorities feel on any given day.  Keep your head up, don't get <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Discourage" data-meaning="(verb) - to take away courage, hope, confidence">discouraged</span>.   Continue to wear a smile while wearing a mask, some people will notice it.  Wave at your neighbors while walking down the street in hopes that you will break down those barriers that have been created, and <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Fortify " data-meaning="(verb) - to strengthen">fortified</span> as a result of this virus.   I was out on a "supply run" two days ago(sounds so apocalyptic, The Walking Dead-ish I know) and two local kids were <span class="word" data-modal-target="#modal" data-word="Intently" data-meaning="(adverb) - sharply focused, steadfastly fixed">intently</span> watching us at a distance.  We waved at each other, continued on our way home.  Little things like that are inspiring and give us hope throughout all of this,</p>

        <p>Peace and Love</p>

        <p><strong><u>Pay attention to the highlighted words</u></strong></p>

        <p><strong>Past Perfect</strong></p>

        <p>had+3rd form/past participle</p>

        <p>-this tense is used when we want to state that one action happened before another action in the past(both actions finished in the past too)</p>

        <p>-if we are only talking about one past action, there is no need to use past perfect(use past simple)</p>

        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>He <strong>had worked</strong> as a teacher until the crisis <strong>started</strong> (two past finished actions, past perfect is the first action)</p>

        <p>He <strong>worked</strong> as a teacher many years ago (past simple, only one action.  We don't need to define which action happened first when there is only one action</p>

        <p>There is much more to learn about tenses and grammar!  If you have any questions, get ahold of me and lets schedule your first appointment! </p>
