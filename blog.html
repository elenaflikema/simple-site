People have been objecting to the "stay home" orders initiated by their governments and decide that they know what is best.  The evidence is telling.  Videos and photos of hundreds of people laying on beaches, spending time in public places, parents allowing their kids to mingle with others on the playground, etc.   A lack of accountability, selfishness, and carelessness are some reasons that this virus is going to be dragged out. Many more people are going to suffer due to others ignorance and self-centeredness.  It's a pity. </p>

                    <p class="article_beginning">If you haven't read my blog about my gas chamber experience in bootcamp,  take a look at that first! I've been wearing a mask in public for the past two weeks or so.  It isn't always comfortable, but it is necessary in this era.  Many people however, laugh it off, make a mockery of those who wear masks, and take precautions.  The mask has become a part of me.  The group of people who ridicule those who wear masks are mostly foreigners here who claim that it will not protect you, it is useless.  Those foreigners exacerbate the issues we are already dealing with.  As expats, we are viewed as a problem, carriers of the virus (as I mentioned in a previous blog).  By not wearing a mask, we are solidifying this stereotype and enforcing the discrimination which we are up against.</p>

Three weeks ago, I was filled with emotion!  I was thrilled and impatient about what was to come. Yesterday evening I had a look at that list and crossed out everything on it.  From Elena's birthday trip to Phu Quoc(which should be happening on Monday), to relocating to Bali, and the filming of this TV show(it is still going to happen, just delayed a month or so).  Everything has been either called off or pushed back until further notice.   For a few, it took the wind out of my sails, mentally.</p>

There are an infinite number of answers to this question due to cultural differences, the ways we were brought up,  different generations and more.  I had a lengthy discussion with a client of mine today and I'm sure we could have gone on talking about it for hours. Our talk stirred up some memories of my grandfather and his version of success.</p>

It pushed me to reflect on who I am, the things I have done, the choices I have made, and why I am who I am now.   What side do you take? Do you align yourself with a group, faction, or party based on your principles and values, or lean in another direction because it is the popular, hip, comfortable, easy, or “acceptable” path to follow?</p>

So many things are happening in the next months, it makes it hard to believe that everything will go according to plan.</p>

As usual, we went over vocabulary and some grammar which we then applied to our discussion. Our memories are not always bright and happy, right?  From time to time those negative experiences can creep back from the darkest depths of our minds and put us in a "mood",or even worse, those memories and experiences can influence the way we live our lives today.</p>
